###A minimal boilerplate with Grunt and Stylus integration

Slate eliminates the tedious tasks associated with starting a new project, allowing you to focus on what really matters.

Getting Started
-----

First, clone the repository. Then `cd` to the project directory and run `npm install` which will install all the project dependencies. After the install is complete, initiate `grunt watch`, enabling grunt to monitor the `stylus` directory and compile when changes have been made to any `.styl` files.

    $ git clone https://github.com/colebemis/slate.git [project directory]
    $ cd [project directory]
    $ npm install
    $ grunt watch
